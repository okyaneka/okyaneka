# Hello 👋, I'm Oky Aneka, a frontend engineer specializing in VueJS & React

Hi there, I'm Oky Aneka, a frontend engineer based in Yogyakarta 🇮🇩. I've been working as frontend engineer since 2020.

Before I became a frontend engineer, I had tried to studying many things in the world of websites, starting from fullstack, monolith, backend and finally I decided to study frontend engineering more deeply. I think, frontend engineering is an exciting world. Here I feel, I can visualize several lines of text into something that is comfortable to look at.
